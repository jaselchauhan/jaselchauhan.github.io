description: sparewall is a website which connects people who own spare walls with those who want to paint them. It was made for my second project at GA WDI and was built in 5 days using Ruby, Sinatra, MVC design pattern with full RESTful routes, Google Maps API, BCrypt, Bower Components and a dash of Hipster Ipsum!
